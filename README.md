# Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify patients as either having or not having heart disease based on a set of medical attributes.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aavigan/cleveland-clinic-heart-disease-dataset). It consists of 303 instances with 14 features. The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. It has also been split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

**Algorithms:**

The following machine learning algorithms have been explored for heart disease prediction:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Gausian Naive Bayes
6. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
7. Gradient Boosting Classifier

Each algorithm was chosen for its potential to handle classification tasks and its suitability for the heart disease prediction domain.

**Usage:**

To reproduce the results and run the project, follow these instructions:

1. Load the dataset into the project.
2. Use the provided code to preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and apply any necessary feature scaling or transformations.
3. Execute the code for each algorithm to train and evaluate the models.
4. Review the evaluation metrics and performance results generated by the code.

**Evaluation:**

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated to assess model performance. The evaluation results for each algorithm are provided, allowing for easy comparison and analysis.

**Future Improvement:**

Possible areas of future improvement for this project include:

1. Incorporating more advanced machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods.
2. Conducting further feature engineering to enhance model performance.
3. Exploring additional evaluation metrics and techniques for a more comprehensive analysis.
